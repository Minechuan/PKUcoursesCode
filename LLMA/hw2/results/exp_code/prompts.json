So Janet got 40 / 4 = 10 stuffies.\n\nCome up with a question and reasoning that would justify [160] as the answer.\nThe question is: Ofelia joined a saving challenge wherein she has to save twice the amount she saved from the previous month. In January, she saved $10. How much is she going to save in May?\nReasoning: Ofelia saves $10 x 2 = $20 in February. She will save $20x 2 = $40 in March. She will save $40 x 2 = $80 in April. Thus, she will save $80 x 2 = $160 in May.\n\nCome up with a question and reasoning that would justify [140] as the answer.\n"

So the Sigurdsons ensure that everyone on the hard-working team has a passion for food, customer service or both, \"Nothing's greater than when a customer has a huge smile on his or her face after taking a bite of our food,\" revealed Carrie.\nDon't believe them?

        "prompt": "Can you confirm if the Durkee Embroidery Hoop - 24cm x 24cm (9\"x9\") Square is compatible with the Brother PR600/Baby Lock Series machines? Answer according to: NOTE: This item comes in a GREY Color, not available in Black. Note: Can only use up to 8x9\" designs on Brother PR machines, unless you are splitting designs on your embroidery software or Brother's PE Design software first. Double height, 24cm x 24cm (9″×9″) square frame. Fits Brother PR600/Baby Lock Series machines. Common uses: Children’s clothing, larger square designs that round hoops cannot accommodate. This hoop fits the Brother PR600, PR-600C, PR600II, PR620, PR650, PR1000, and the PR1000e and the Baby Lock EMP6, BMP8, BMP9 and ENT10 embroidery machines. The hoop carries a LIFETIME WARRANTY on the plastic components and feature Durkee’s exclusive EZ TURN Thumbscrew. Ships with the brackets attached. Grids not available. *To embroider a design of 5 x 7\" you must allow for the design itself, as well as, the sewing head. The next size up for that from Durkee would be our 9” x 9” hoop. As long as that size hoop will fit into the project you are embroidering, that would be your best bet from Durkee. It also happens to be the most popular hoop size we sell to the home embroidery market. It is our pleasure to detail the guarantee provided for our tubular hoop line. We guarantee the plastic component of the round hoops for a lifetime against manufacturer's defects. We will exchange the plastic component at no cost provided the breakage is not due to abuse or using the parts in a manner not consistent with commercial embroidery practices. The Durkee Embroidery Hoop - 24cm x 24cm (9\"x9\") Square is great for embroidering children’s clothing and larger square designs that round hoops cannot accommodate.This Durkee Embroidery Hoop - 24cm x 24cm (9\"x9\") Square is constructed of high impact plastic making it virtually indestructible. The Durkee Embroidery Hoop - 24cm x 24cm (9\"x9\") Square has brass inserts for all screws, light texture on the hooping surface, directional guides, and extra height, which aids in holding thicker, harder to hold garments. The adjusting rings' thumb screws on the Durkee Embroidery Hoop - 24cm x 24cm (9\"x9\") Square are large and long to provide more torque and have a wider space for adjustments. The metal clips on the Durkee Embroidery Hoop - 24cm x 24cm (9\"x9\") Square are extra long, aiding in vibration reduction. The Durkee Embroidery Hoop - 24cm x 24cm (9\"x9\") Square metal clips are zinc plated to provide reduced wear, and they come complete with plastic screws and lock washers. Thumb screw is larger and longer than our competitors'. Wide space thumb screw adjusting. For optimum design registration, it is important to use a hoop that is closest to the size of the design. This will help eliminate puckering as well as wasting other supplies, such as backing or topping. Very efficient and the website worked out great for me! The hoop is wonderful. It allows for a larger size design than a 5x7 on a kid shirt. the only problem is that the threads strip after a while leaving the hoop unusable. I love the hoop though so I am about to order my 4th one. Will order again from your site! The price was right. I'll be shopping here again. Love you guys... just you have so many items that sometimes it is hard to find what I am looking for. I purchased this hoop in 2011 and recently wanted to use it for an 8\" x 8\". The hoop is not large enough as the corners are too rounded and the hoop will not accommodate a square design. The wrong Durkee hoop was sent but Delores was wonderful and took care of the problem to my complete satisfaction. Will definitely order from All Brands again! I will order from Allbrands before any other internet business when possible because of the friendly, prompt response to all orders and the best prices on nearly all items. Very rarely do I find an item priced cheaper, but I still order from Allbrands because of the very prompt filling of orders. Shipment was fast, price was good. Love the hoop."

        "prompt": "Pitch: Self-serve credentialing work management dashboard\nAuthor: Ermal Hajrizi \nReviewers: Caitlin Barrett Jeff Kantarek Erin Nicolle Robert Page Yenny Zhang Chris Chen Kelly Chang \nMotivation\nFor clients managing their credentialing via internal operations teams, one of the most import organizational aspects of that process is assignment of work. In this case, the unit of work is a credentialing file, requiring an \"owner\". Generally, the first step after a credentialing application is identified / requested is the assignment of this work to a credentialing specialist. This may happen either via an admin who oversees assignment, or via the specialist themselves picking up a file to work on. \nThis assignment system becomes especially important at scale, ensuring that larger teams dealing with significant credentialing volume are able to stay organized. This is table stakes for all self-serve organizations, and is a key part of the workflow for Tivity (our self-serve design partner).\nGoals\nSelf-serve credentialing for payers\nAppetite\nLarge appetite: this is must-have functionality for a self-serve credentialing product - whether for payers or not - and something we must tackle before launch. \nApproach\nAt a high-level, we envision this as an expansion of our credentialing page, adopting some of the functionality seen in our staff dashboards for Licensing and PE, (but limited to a single organization). Specifically, we need to \nAdd the concept of staff assignment (client or Medallion staff) to each credentialing service request. \nEnable the ability to assign, re-assign, and un-assign staff from a single request. \nEnable assignment, re-assignment, and un-assignment in bulk.\nThe ability to filter the credentialing table by assignment. This is important so that specialists can filter for work assigned to them. \nOpen questions:\nDo we leverage / copy the user type that health systems has created for their self-serve product (medical staff)?\nResources Needed\nEngineering\nEstimate is conditional on whether we want to add the bulk action component of this pitch. See question at the bottom of this pitch.\nwith bulk action: 3-4 weeks\nwithout bulk action: 2 weeks\nThis will involve:\nBackend (1 week)\nadd coordinator to GraphQL filter for CredentialingServiceRequests\n1-2 days work\nadd is\\_medallion\\_owned, coordinator fields to the CSR GraphQL schema\n1-2 days work\nability to do bulk mutations of updating coordinator on CSRs\n2 days work?\nFrontend (1-2 weeks?)\nSingle Action (1 week)\nadding is\\_medallion\\_owned, coordinator cols to the CredentialingRequestsList component\nability to change these fields\nBulk Action (1 week)\nadd a credentialing requests bulk update modal\ncurrently seems like we only need to support updating coordinator? \nadding a \"Staff Actions\" button to show a modal similar to the ServiceRequestBulkModal that can be used to assign, re-assign, and un-assign coordinators\nDesign\ncan re-use concepts from other service requests list\nStaff License Requests\n\"Staff Actions\" button \nUpdate Service Requests Bulk Modal\nwill probably need a custom modal for Credentialing Service Requests. the pic shows the License Request bulk update modal\n\nRisks\nIs there anything that might derail execution?\nNeed to ensure overlap with other work is considered (particularly w/ health systems)\nHave not encountered this yet in-market, but it's theoretically possible that some clients may consider the PSV as the \"unit of work\", wanting to assign specialists to specific PSV types. Again, not something we have seen in-market, but our own BPO team operates that way (though the context is slightly different as they are working across orgs and are not responsible for other related parts of the credentialing process, like outreach). \nDo we need to support the bulk action component to update coordinators in this project pitch, or can we loop it into the bulk actions pitch/project? How important is it to do this asap?\n\n---\n\nuse the above document to generate a release plan and developer tasks to accomplish the work"

        "prompt": "Can you explain this abstract in layman's term: The metamaterial paradigm has allowed an unprecedented space-time control of various physical fields, including elastic and acoustic waves. Despite the wide variety of metamaterial configurations proposed so far, most of the existing solutions display a frequency response that cannot be tuned, once the structures are fabricated. Few exceptions include systems controlled by electric or magnetic fields, temperature, radio waves and mechanical stimuli, which may often be unpractical for real-world implementations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce here a polymeric 3D-printed elastic metamaterial whose transmission spectrum can be deterministically tuned by a light field. We demonstrate the reversible doubling of the width of an existing frequency band gap upon selective laser illumination. This feature is exploited to provide an elastic-switch functionality with a one-minute lag time, over one hundred cycles. In perspective, light-responsive components can bring substantial improvements to active devices for elastic wave control, such as beam-splitters, switches and filters."

        "prompt": "Can you summarize the mission and activities of the Umbrella Club of Lower Fairfield County?\nGenerate according to: For the past 29 years, the members of the Umbrella Club of Lower Fairfield County have been meeting once a month at Zody's 19th Hole Restaurant, a friendly joint overlooking the Gaynor E. Brennan Golf Course on the Greenwich-Stamford border. They gather there to eat, drink, mingle -- and figure out who they are going to help next with generous cash contributions.\nMaybe it will be children with severe health issues (a favorite cause), or maybe it will be the Yale-New Haven Pediatric Eye Clinic Center or Stamford Hospital.\nSince the the local group's first meeting, the club has given away more than $2.5 million.\nThe story of how the club got its name goes back to the 1960s when a dozen guys from Westchester and Fairfield County met for lunch to eat, drink, and discuss a friend in need who they all decided to contribute to. A sudden rainstorm kept them from their cars until one of them spotted a vendor selling umbrellas and procured enough umbrellas for all. The group decided to meet monthly to help those in need and call themselves the Tri-County Umbrella Club. The lower Fairfield County Umbrella Club is an offshoot.\nAt last month's meeting of the local club, some of the 50 or so members drift in -- from Greenwich, Stamford, Westport, Darien and Norwalk. Among them is Pucci, a former Greenwich policeman, and Steve Wolpo, a dentist from Stamford who says he learned of the club from one of his patients. Seated at the dais is Bruce Moore, of Stamford, club president; Mike Mezzapelle, of Stamford, treasurer; and Hank Anderson, of Stamford, secretary.\nThe long tables fill up and there's lots of camaraderie -- a hallmark of guys who share a passion. But the meeting comes quickly to order. There's business to attend to.\nFirst, everyone stands to sing \"The Umbrella Song\" (and no, it is not the one by Rihanna).\n\"We'll have some fun when our work is done.../ We're still rough and ready guys,\" they sing, \"But right now let's just harmonize.../ We'll give a little help now to kids that need our help now/ So give a cheer - The Umbrella Club is here!\"\nNext, a moment of silence is held for \"those who need our prayers,\" says Moore.\nThen, the roll call is read.\n\"We want active members,\" says Orrico in an aside. \"We talk to them if they don't show up.\"\nClub treasurer and CPA Mezzapelle follows and gives his report for 2013: \"We brought in $250,000 between fundraising and contributions, of which $100,000 goes to individuals and charities and $50,000 to our annual pledge (over six years) to Stamford Hospital,\" he says. \"We have approximately $490,000 in total assets.\"\nMezzapelle then urges members on the raffle ticket committee to get active selling the $100 tickets for their 30th Annual Car Raffle fundraiser taking place on Feb. 5 at the Italian Center of Stamford. \"It's expected to raise approximately $70, 000,\" he says. Another fundraiser, the annual Spring Golf Outing, is expected to raise an additional $48,000.\nScott Kelly, a financial advisor from Norwalk is up next. He's chair of the group's Good & Welfare Committee and shares the facts and figures on the people the group is currently supporting.\n\"We have four individuals with requested funds,\" he says. \"We need to raise money for these individuals. All are at the limits of their insurance, and certain therapies are not covered.\"\n\"Kenneth Romaine is a 20-year-old with leukemia (both parents work for the town of Greenwich), and $4,000 is needed for treatment and transportation to Yale New Haven to see his doctor,\" says Kelly.\n\"Jamison O'Meara from Trumbull is a 4 ½-year-old with severe epilepsy and autism and $5,000 is needed to get him down to Maryland to the Kennedy Krieger Institute,\" he continues. \"Karissa Craddock from Trumbull is a 7-year-old with Spina bifida who can't walk and $3,500 is needed for aquatic therapy and physical therapy. And Sheri Restal, a 19-year-old girl from Stamford with Down syndrome needs $1,500 for speech therapy.\"\nOrrico answers the question begging to be asked. How does the club learn about these individuals?\n\"They come to us by word of mouth,\" he says, \"from hospital directors, from the Department of Social Services, from Abilis, from the Stamford Home Initiative, from people we've helped before, from our website.\"\n\"We investigate the person,\" Orrico continues, \"and see where the money is to go to that person.\"\nOver 90 percent of the club's funds go to individuals and charities, according to Orrico.\n\"Every one of us donates our time,\" he says, \"with the rest going for the paperwork.\"\nAnd just like that, the gavel sounds and it is time for the members to go back to their real jobs, as bankers, accountants, dentists or policemen -- until next month.\nFor more information on the Umbrella Club, visit www.umbrellaclub.org."

You should categorize the question into matching, summary, logic, arithmetic and, commonsense groups. Matching is a question entailed or paraphrased by exactly one sentence in a dialogue. The answer can be extracted from the same sentence. Questions that cannot be answered by the surface meaning of a single sentence belong to the reasoning category. We further define summary, logic, arithmetic and, commonsense subcategories. Answering summary questions requires the whole picture of dialogue, such as the topic of dialogue and the relation between speakers. We require logical reasoning to answer logical questions. in arithmetic questions Inferring the answer requires arithmetic knowledge. To answer commonsense questions, besides the textual information in the dialogue, we also require additional commonsense knowledge that cannot be obtained from the dialogue. Note that a question can be in more than one group. \"W\" and \"M\" in the conversations stand for \"woman\" and \"man\".\nQ: M: Excuse me! Do you mind if I sit here? W: Not at all. Go ahead. M: Thank you. W: Are you going somewhere, or are you meeting someone? M: I'm on my way to Washington. And you? W: I'm on my way to San Francisco. M: Really? I think San Francisco is probably the most exciting city in the US. W: So do I. No other city has as many good restaurants or as much good music. M: En, neither do I, really. But small towns have their advantages, less traffic. W: And friendlier people. You know, I'm beginning to feel homesick. By the way, where are you from? M: China. W: China?

Pacino is astounding, as always, and well, this movie marked the period where Madonna was her absolute sexiest. I wish she had stuck with the \"Breathless\" look for a while longer. Charlie Korsmo's first really big role, other than \"What about bob?\". The makeup effects were cutting edge then and still hold up for the most part. Beautiful scenery and mood transport you directly into a comic strip environment. The cars, wardrobe, buildings, and even the streetlights et a great tone, not to mention the perfect lighting, although the scenes with a lot of red can get a tad annoying, as it tends to blur a little. Just wish Beatty had gotten the chance to make a sequel. All in all, a fun few hours.\nStudent:"

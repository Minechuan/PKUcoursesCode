    "## Amari-Hopfield Network  \n",
    "Let's begin from studying the one of the most classic attractor neural network model -- **Amari-Hopfield Network**.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This network consists of $N$ neurons, each state is denoted as **$S_i (i=1,2,...,N)$**. This model assumes the neuron can only be at **two binary states, i.e., $S_i = +1 / -1$**, representing the neuron can only be either activated or silenced at one time. The neurons are recurrently connected with each other, the connection strength can be expressed as a matrix **$W$**.  \n",
    "The update rule of the network is expressed as,  \n",
    "$$S_i(t+1) = sign(\\sum_{j=1}^N W_{ij}S_j(t) - \\theta)$$  \n",
    "where $\\sum_{j=1}^N W_{ij}S_j(t)$ represents the total recurrent input current the $i_{th}$ neuron receives at time $t$, which in turn determines the neuron state in the next time. Specifically, if the recurrent input exceeds a certain threshold $\\theta$, the neuron state $S_i=1$, otherwise $S_i = -1$.  \n",
    "It should be noted that, the update of different neurons are asynchoronous, which means that at each time only one neuron state will change.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Amari and Hopfield proved that, to store $n$ different **patterns $\\xi^\\mu (\\mu = 1,2,...n)$** as attractor states in this network, the synaptic weights between i-th an j-th neuron $W_{ij}$ should be:  \n",
    "$$W_{ij} = \\sum_{\\mu=1}^n \\xi_i^\\mu \\xi_j^\\mu$$  \n",
    "where $W_{ii}=0$, representing that neurons do not connect with itself.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The energy function $E$ is expressed as,  \n",
    "$$ E = -\\frac{1}{2} \\sum_{i,j}W_{ij} S_i S_j + \\theta \\sum_i S_i"
